# Placement Prediction using Machine Learning

This project was developed as part of a 10-day training program on *Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning* organized under RUSA Component 12 in collaboration with the *Bombay Stock Exchange Institute* and *Government Engineering College, Gandhinagar*.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a *Placement Prediction System* using machine learning algorithms. It predicts whether a student will be placed or not based on academic performance and other relevant features.

The project includes data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and a simple GUI for user interaction.

## Features

- Data Preprocessing:
  - Handling missing values
  - Label Encoding
  - Feature Scaling

- Machine Learning Models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree Classifier

- Model Evaluation:
  - Accuracy Score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report

- GUI:
  - Developed using Tkinter for interactive prediction

## Dataset

- Source: Kaggle 

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn
- Tkinter
